{- import qualified ... as ... ?

To use a function from a qualified import
you need to prefix its name with its alias and a dot:
P.head   C.toUpper   etc.

I import these for you to test the original functions on ghci:

ghci> :t C.toUpper
C.toUpper :: Char -> Char

You MUST NOT use ANY of these in your code

{- Our lists vs Haskell lists

Our definition:

data List a where
  Nil  :: List a
  Cons :: a -> List a -> List a

Here we use Haskell's built-in lists and associated syntactic sugar.
It is as if it was defined like this:

    data [a] = [] | (x : xs)

or like this:

    data [a] where
      []  :: [a]
      (:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]

write [a]       for our List a
write []        for our List
write []        for our Nil
write (x : xs)  for our Cons x xs
write [u,v]     for our u `Cons` (v `Cons` Nil)
